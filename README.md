# Thailand, France & Canada Time

This project displays the current time in Thailand (Bangkok), France (Paris) and Canada (Toronto) on a single web page.

## Features

* **Real‑time clocks**: Times are updated every second using JavaScript’s `Intl.DateTimeFormat` API, so they always reflect the correct time in all locations, accounting for daylight saving time in each region (e.g. France and Canada).
* **Modern design**: The page uses a clean layout inspired by Airbnb’s visual style, with soft colours and a coral accent. It leverages the [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) typeface for a friendly, approachable feel.
* **Responsive**: The layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes thanks to the use of flexbox.

## Getting Started

Simply open `index.html` in your browser. The page will fetch the current time for Bangkok and Paris from your device and update automatically every second.

If hosted on GitHub Pages, the site will be publicly accessible via the configured Pages URL.
